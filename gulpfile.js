// Our objective is to make some html stubs and be able to have the browser change everytime we save.
// So the first parameter is the gulp task name. This is what we call on the command line.
// When we run gulp serve, it will fire a function that initializes browserSync and serves up
// the index.html from the base of the project.
// the gulp.watch will look for changes in the .html and the .css files.
// At this point, try running gulp serve.
// Then, with the app up, change both the index.html & the main.css files. Be sure to save.
// It doesn't work if you just change the .css and save.
// We'll add more hear later.
